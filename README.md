# Proximity_sound 
A suggestive way to be aware of the distance to an object

# Idea
A software designed to get the distance to an object and output a sound.

# Requirements & Implementation
## Physical requirements
* Arduino Uno with the USB cable
* Proximity sensor
* Arduino-compatible speaker
* Laptop

## Software requirements
* [Arduino IDE](https:www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* C/C++ compiler
* A text editor 

## Implementation
A C program developed in the Arduino IDE takes the input from the proximity sensor and outputs through the speaker a sound, and it's frequency increases as the distance decreases.
